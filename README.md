- Instruction
    - In the starting page you will be asked to enter mapsize and the enemy spawnrate
        <br><img src="./data/screenshots/startpage.png" alt="Screenshot of the start page" width="300"><br>
        - Map Height: max amount of tiles in a column for the map
        - Map Width: max amount of tiles in a column for the map
        - SpawnRate: The probability (%) that an enemy will spawn on an empty tile when the game starts.
            - The total number of enemies cannot exceed 50% of the total tiles on the map.
            - A higher spawn rate means more enemies, but the limit is still half of the map size.
        - Heres an example of a 4x4 map with 20% spawn rate
        <br><img src="./data/screenshots/mapexample.png" alt="Screenshot of the start page" width="300"><br>
    - Player has to move the arrow key to go around the map.
    - Fighting will be triggered when player walks into a tile with enemy
